### Translating a Single Entry
If you would like to review the content you are sending for translation, you can first open it in the Visual Editor. In the editor, select the Translate option to access a translation screen where you can specify your translation requirements.

### Translating Multiple Entries
To translate multiple entries at once, select the desired items on the screen and choose the Translate option. This will open the translation screen where you can define your translation specifications. All selected entries will be included in the same translation request. If you wish to apply different settings to each file, you must send them for translation individually.
