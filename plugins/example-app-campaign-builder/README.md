## Getting started

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BuilderIO/builder.git
cd plugins/example-simple-app
npm install
```

### Develop

```bash
npm start
```

### Add the plugin in Builder.io

From [builder.io](https://builder.io) open the javascript console in your browser's dev tools and run.

```js
// Adds the plugin
builder.plugins.replace(['http://localhost:1268/plugin.system.js'])
// Saves for all in your organization and reloads the browser
builder.savePlugins().then(() => location.reload())
```

**NOTE:** Loading http:// content on an https:// website will give you a warning. Be sure to click the shield in the top right of your browser and choose "load unsafe scripts" to allow the http content on Builder's https site when devloping locally

Now as you develop you can restart Builder to see the latest version of your plugin.

To uninstall your plugin run

```js
// Removes all plugins
builder.plugins.replace([])
// Saves for all in your organization and reloads the browser
builder.savePlugins().then(() => location.reload())
```

### Publishing

We recommend sending us a pull request with your plugin so we can publish it on your behalf.

If required, you can also publish to your own NPM or a hosting service.

To load a plugin from NPM

```js
builder.plugins.replace(['@builder.io/plugin-example'])
```

#### Advanced

You can load a plugin from a specific version

```js
builder.plugins.replace(['@builder.io/plugin-example@1.0.0'])
```

Or from a URL

```js
builder.plugins.replace(['https://something.com/foo'])
```
