# Jodit plugin to override built-in rich text

The built-in rich text editor (Quill) cannot meet the needs of my business. Currently, I am using another rich text editor, [Jodit](https://xdsoft.net/jodit), which includes additional features to serve the business such as tables, videos, symbols, and more.

### How to run this plugin
