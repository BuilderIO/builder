# White-labeling Builder.io App plugin

## Getting started

This example relies on enterprise features of Builder, please make sure you have the right space permissions/subscription before starting, if you don't, you can contact help@builder.io with your use case, and we'll set a proof of concept space for you.

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Develop

```bash
npm start
```

### Add the plugin in Builder.io

Builder.io support will setup the space for you, pointing to the plugin on localhost, `http://localhost:1268/plugin.system.js`

**NOTE:** Loading http:// content on an https:// website will give you a warning. Be sure to click the shield in the top right of your browser and choose "load unsafe scripts" to allow the http content on Builder's https site when devloping locally

Now as you develop you can restart Builder to see the latest version of your plugin.

### Publishing

When done developing on localhost, you publish to your own NPM or a hosting service.

To load a plugin from NPM

```js
builder.plugins.replace(['my-npm-module-name'])
```

#### Advanced

You can load a plugin from a specific version

```js
builder.plugins.replace(['my-npm-module-name@1.0.0'])
```

Or from a URL

```js
builder.plugins.replace(['https://something.com/foo'])
```
