# Builder.io example with Sveltekit

This example shows our [Svelte SDK](/packages/sdks/output/svelte) with Sveltekit.

## Builder.io Setup

- log into builder.io
- from your account page, copy your API key and paste it into BUILDER_API_KEY in `DynamicallyRenderBuilderPage.svelte`
- open the Builder.io Visual Editor for the model named "page"
- enter http://localhost:3000 in the URL bar to the top right of the preview in Builder
- drag a component into the layers tab, and it will appear in the Editor!
