# Example of using Builder.io with React Native (alpha)

## About

This is an early preview of our Builder.io SDK for React native. See [App.jsx](./App.jsx) for usage. The visual editing is powered by [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web). This example uses [Expo](https://expo.io/), but Expo is not required for using Builder.io with React Native

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BuilderIO/builder.git
cd examples/react-native
npm install
npm run web
```

Then log into `beta.builder.io` and open the Visual Editor for any model named "page" (or change [App.jsx](./App.jsx) to be `model="your-model-name"`) and enter `http://localhost:19006` in the URL bar to the top right of the preview in Builder

## Status

Currently, this example supports the Box, Text, and Image components, as well as using custom components
