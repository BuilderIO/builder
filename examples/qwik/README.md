# Builder.io example with Qwik

This example shows our [Qwik SDK](/packages/sdks/output/qwik) with Qwik + Qwikcity.

## Builder.io Setup

- log into builder.io
- from your account page, copy your API key and paste it into BUILDER_API_KEY in `src/routes/[...index]/index.tsx`
- open the Builder.io Visual Editor for the model named "page"
- enter http://localhost:3000 in the URL bar to the top right of the preview in Builder
- drag a component into the layers tab, and it will appear in the Editor!

## Status

For the status of the SDK, look at [these tables](/packages/sdks/README.md#feature-implementation).

## Build Setup

```shell
# install dependencies
npm install
```

## Development

Development mode uses [Vite's development server](https://vitejs.dev/). During development, the `dev` command will server-side render (SSR) the output.

```shell
npm run dev
```

> Note: during dev mode, Vite may request a significant number of `.js` files. This does not represent a Qwik production build.

## Preview

The preview command will create a production build of the client modules, a production build of `src/entry.preview.tsx`, and run a local server. The preview server is only for convenience to locally preview a production build, and it should not be used as a production server.

```shell
npm run preview
```

## Production

The production build will generate client and server modules by running both client and server build commands. Additionally, the build command will use Typescript to run a type check on the source code.

```shell
npm run build
```

## Vercel Edge

This starter site is configured to deploy to [Vercel Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions), which means it will be rendered at an edge location near to your users.

## Installation

The adaptor will add a new `vite.config.ts` within the `adapters/` directory, and a new entry file will be created, such as:

```
└── adapters/
    └── vercel-edge/
        └── vite.config.ts
└── src/
    └── entry.vercel-edge.tsx
```

Additionally, within the `package.json`, the `build.server` script will be updated with the Vercel Edge build.

## Production build

To build the application for production, use the `build` command, this command will automatically run `npm run build.server` and `npm run build.client`:

```shell
npm run build
```

[Read the full guide here](https://github.com/BuilderIO/qwik/blob/main/starters/adapters/vercel-edge/README.md)

## Dev deploy

To deploy the application for development:

```shell
npm run deploy
```

Notice that you might need a [Vercel account](https://docs.Vercel.com/get-started/) in order to complete this step!

## Production deploy

The project is ready to be deployed to Vercel. However, you will need to create a git repository and push the code to it.

You can [deploy your site to Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/overview) either via a Git provider integration or through the Vercel CLI.
