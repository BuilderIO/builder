# Builder.io example with React v2 Beta SDK

This example shows our [React v2 Beta SDK](/packages/sdks/output/react) with React + Vite.

## Builder.io Setup

- log into builder.io
- from your account page, copy your API key and paste it into BUILDER_API_KEY in `App.jsx`
- open the Builder.io Visual Editor for the model named "page"
- enter http://localhost:3000 in the URL bar to the top right of the preview in Builder
- drag a component into the layers tab, and it will appear in the Editor!
