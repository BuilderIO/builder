WORKS ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
- Svelte

Partially working:
- Qwik: Bundles, but there is a code issue with calling `rootSetState`
- NextJS: Bundles, but has an issue importing the server bundle from the client bundle.
- React: Bundles correctly everywhere except Next App Dir project. Probably same issue as above

NEXT UP:
- Vue
- Solid
- ReactNative




LATER:
- add back `codeEvaluator` prop to `fetchBuilderProps`
