TO-DO: 
- [ ] decide whether to put isolated-vm in peerDeps or deps:
  -  try publishing a dev version with `isolated-vm` under `deps` and uploading it to an edge server, to see if it works.
  That's the main concern around having it in deps.

- [ ] fix errors in VM code execution.
  - nextjs:
    - 1 test case, reactivity issue (`rootSetState` ?)
  - qwik:
    - code issue with calling `rootSetState` most likely
  - vue3:
    - ??
    
  - nextjs/qwik: see what changes need to be made when `rootSetState` is not provided.
