- svelte: works
- react-native: works
- react: works
- solidjs: works
- vue2: works

- nextjs: breaks: 
  - 1 test case, reactivity issue (`rootSetState` ?)
- qwik: breaks:
  - code issue with calling `rootSetState` most likely
- vue3: breaks
  - unable to build, duplicate symbol identifiers.
  


Next up:
- fix the nuxt3 build somehow.
  - try a brand new nuxt3 starter, see if that works
- check the failures in nextjs/qwik, see what changes need to be made when `rootSetState` is not provided.
