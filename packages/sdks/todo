#1- adding multiple bundles

WORKS ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
- Svelte
- React
- Vue3
- Qwik
- Solid

Should be fixed:
- Vue2: Nuxt2 bundling issues (cannot find dependency)

Breaks:
- NextJS: bundling issues (importing server bundle from client bundle)


IN PROGRESS:
- React Native: not done yet






FINAL PR:

WORKS ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
- Svelte

Partially working:
- Qwik: Bundles, but there is a code issue with calling `rootSetState`
- NextJS: Bundles, but has an issue importing the server bundle from the client bundle.
- React: Bundles correctly everywhere except Next App Dir project. Probably same issue as above

NEXT UP:
- Vue
- Solid
- ReactNative




LATER:
- add back `codeEvaluator` prop to `fetchBuilderProps`

MISC:
- e2e tests: add check for all tests of absence of warnings:
  - Vue received a Component which was made a reactive object
  - NextJS hydration mismatch
