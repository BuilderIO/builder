Why does `isolated-vm` not work?

- svelte: works
- react-native: works

- react: breaks
- nextjs: breaks
- qwik: breaks
  - need to OptimizeDeps.exclude `isolated-vm`
  - ships `/lib/node/index.qwik.js` instead of `/lib/browser/index.qwik.js` to the browser. probably a Qwik Vite plugin bug.
- solidjs: breaks
- vue2: breaks
- vue3: breaks
  - seems to load just fine but tests fail.
  

Fundamentally, is this a bundling issue? in a clean repo, I am able to import and use `isolated-vm` just fine.
  - is this a yarn issue specific to this yarn version?
  - is this a workspaces issue? we can test by releasing a dev version.


Actual VM implementation is only partially working:
- Qwik: Bundles, but there is a code issue with calling `rootSetState`



debugging the issues:
- Qwik: rollup breaks due to SDK being in monorepo. qwikcity routeLoader$ import is initialized too late
