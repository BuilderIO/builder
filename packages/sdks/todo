Investigate why the `isolated-vm` module isn't being imported correctly:
- last commit tries to pass `serverExecutor` from the start
- tried vue and react, neither work
  - probably wanna focus on an SDK that uses vite to bundle, since we need to externalize the `isolated-vm` module. So React SDK wouldn't be good for now.

Test with Qwik SDK first:

Fix build:
- create 3 vite bundles, each aliasing the #code-evaluator path to the right file
- check if this works correctly in all 3 envs

Then:
- add back `codeEvaluator` prop to `fetchBuilderProps`




Svelte: WORKS ðŸŽ‰
Qwik: Bundles, but there is a code issue with calling rootSetState
NextJS: Bundles, but has an issue importing the server bundle from the client bundle.
