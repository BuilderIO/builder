TO-DO:
- NextJS SDK isn't picking up edge runtime code by default.
- We need to make NextJS SDK a `type: module` SDK so that the `exports` work properly
- We need to fix types generation for NextJS SDK, so that it works with `type: module`

NEXT UP:
- bring back strict `.js` extensions to imports/exports
