# Builder.io Vue SDK

This is the Builder Vue SDK. It is currently in beta.

## Getting Started

```
npm install @builder.io/sdk-vue
```

NOTE: if you are using Nuxt, you will need to add the SDK's Nuxt module in `nuxt.config.js`:

```js
// https://nuxt.com/docs/api/configuration/nuxt-config
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  module: ['@builder.io/sdk-vue/nuxt'],
});
```

## CSS

If you are using a SSR framework _other_ than Nuxt, you will need to manually import the CSS by adding the following to your entrypoint, before rendering Builder Content:

```html
<script>
  import '@builder.io/sdk-vue/css';
</script>
```

## Mitosis

This SDK is generated by [Mitosis](https://github.com/BuilderIO/mitosis). To see the Mitosis source-code, go [here](../../).
