- get build + test working locally
  - detox setup, not able to open local build
  - create 'debug' release instead to see if it works


- get build + test working in CI:
  - either use a macos CI machine and do a local build
  - OR use EAS cloud


Steps to get it working locally:
- install applesimutils:
  - brew tap wix/brew
  - brew install applesimutils
- unzip tar after build, before test.

- run `expo start`
- once ready, run detox test in parallel
