- let Mitosis known a piece of Context is reactive @done
  - its type should be wrapped in `Writable` wherever needed... @done
  - `setContext` args are wrapped in `writable()` @done
  - `getContext` usage is prefixed with `$` @done
    - find a way to exclude certain `getContext` assignments from being prefixed with `$`, because we sometimes want to pass the store around as an argument. @done
- `render-block`: @done
  - `childrenContext` should be replaced with just `context`. The workaround is only needed for ReactNative anyways. @done

- `render-repeated-block`: 
  - wrap in `writable()`, 
  - pass the store as an argument.

- `render-content`:
  - instantiate writable store var
  - remove `contentState` state and access store var `rootState` instead
  - remove `getter` for `rootState`

- `context.js`:
  - initialize context with `writable()` // might not be critical
