DONE:
- dropped all JS suffixes (does this break any other SDK?)
- context: good to keep providing it for user's component if ever needed
- Symbol:
  - make it async, and await the content call
- Mitosis: add `use client` only to components that need it (if they have hooks or state)
- solidjs: figure out why its hanging infinitely. look at all the changes made to Block and CompRef etc.
  - something is making it hang
- useState:
  - 1 remaining due to VUE workaround

NEXT UP:
- EnableEditor:
  - add message logic into `useTarget`


REMAINING:

- new `getContent`:
  - take all the hardcoded logic and put it in an external file in the RSC package.
