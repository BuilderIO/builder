DONE:
- dropped all JS suffixes (does this break any other SDK?)
- context: good to keep providing it for user's component if ever needed

REMAINING:
- useState:
  - 1 remaining due to VUE workaround

- Symbol:
  - make it async, and await the content call

- EnableEditor:
  - add message logic into `useTarget`

- Mitosis: add `use client` only to components that need it (if they have hooks or state)

- new `getContent`:
  - take all the hardcoded logic and put it in an external file in the RSC package.
