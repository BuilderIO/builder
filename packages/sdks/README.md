# Builder.io SDKs

These are our new-gen SDKs, generated by [Mitosis](https://github.com/BuilderIO/mitosis). We currently have the following SDKs:

- React-Native
- Vue 2, Vue 3
- Svelte
- SolidJS
- Qwik
- React (experimental)
- NextJS (for App Directory & React Server Components support)

All the individual SDKs live in the [output](./output/) folder. The source Mitosis codebase lives in [src](./src/)

## Development

- To contribute, read our [DEVELOP](./DEVELOP.md) guide.
- To publish, read our [PUBLISHING](./PUBLISHING.md) guide.

## Fetch

This package uses fetch. See [these docs](https://github.com/BuilderIO/this-package-uses-fetch/blob/main/README.md) for more information.

## Non-Node.js Runtimes (Edge, Serverless)

If you plan on using our SDKs in a non-Node.js runtime (serverless, edge workers, etc.), you might need to install the `js-interpreter` package. This package is required to execute dynamic data bindings in non-Node.js runtimes. Note that this package will not be downloaded to your client-side bundle, so it will not increase your bundle size. It will only run on your edge/serverless environments.

`js-interpreter` is a "Peer Dependency" of our SDK. While `npm` installs peer dependencies by default, `yarn` does not. If you get an error like this one:

```
Error importing JS interpreter for non-node runtimes. Make sure you have js-interpreter installed.
Read more here: https://github.com/BuilderIO/builder/tree/main/packages/sdks/README.md#non-nodejs-runtimes-edge-serverless
```

Then make sure to run the following:

```bash
npm install js-interpreter
# or
yarn add js-interpreter
# or
pnpm add js-interpreter
```
