# Builder.io SDKs

These are our new-generation SDKs, generated by [Mitosis](https://github.com/BuilderIO/mitosis). We currently have the following SDKs:

- React-Native
- Vue 3
- Svelte
- SolidJS
- Qwik
- React
- NextJS (Experimental for React Server Components registration support)

All the individual SDKs live in the [output](./output/) folder. The source Mitosis codebase lives in [src](./src/)

View the [Builder.io developer docs](https://www.builder.io/c/docs/developers) for how to use these SDKs

## Development

- To understand the overall architecture of the project, read our [ARCHITECTURE](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) guide.
- To contribute, read our [DEVELOP](./docs/DEVELOP.md) guide.
- To publish, read our [PUBLISHING](./docs/PUBLISHING.md) guide.

## Fetch

This package uses fetch. See [these docs](https://github.com/BuilderIO/this-package-uses-fetch/blob/main/README.md) for more information.

## Node v20 + M1 Macs (Apple Silicon) Support

The SDKs rely on `isolated-vm`, a library to securely execute code on a Node server. There is a compatibility issue for that library when running on Node v20 and M1 Macs. To workaround this issue, you must provide `NODE_OPTIONS=--no-node-snapshot` to the command that runs your server.

If you do not provide this flag, the SDK will skip using `isolated-vm`. This will only occur on Apple Silicon machines that are running Node v20.

For more information, see [this issue](https://github.com/laverdet/isolated-vm/issues/424#issuecomment-1864629126).
