# Gen1 React SDK + Remix (v2) Snippet

> Note: We include `@emotion/core` in `package.json` here because it was unable to correctly bundle the `@emotion/core` from the `@builder.io/react` linked package, (which was trying to use CJS build). However, we won't need this dependency when installing `@builder.io/react` as a standalone package.
