 * The logging system has two modes: default mode and debug mode. In default mode, only logs with
 * log level Notice, Warning and Error will be sent to device. In debug mode, all logs will be sent
 * to device. The log levels that Firebase uses are consistent with the ASL log levels.
 *
 * Enable debug mode by passing the -FIRDebugEnabled argument to the application. You can add this
 * argument in the application's Xcode scheme. When debug mode is enabled via -FIRDebugEnabled,
 * further executions of the application will also be in debug mode. In order to return to default
 * mode, you must explicitly disable the debug mode with the application argument -FIRDebugDisabled.
 *
 * It is also possible to change the default logging level in code by calling setLoggerLevel: on
 * the FIRConfiguration interface.
