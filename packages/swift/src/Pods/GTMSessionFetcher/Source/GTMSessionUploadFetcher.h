// GTMSessionUploadFetcher implements Google's resumable upload protocol.

//
// This subclass of GTMSessionFetcher simulates the series of fetches
// needed for chunked upload as a single fetch operation.
//
// Protocol document:  TBD
//
// To the client, the only fetcher that exists is this class; the subsidiary
// fetchers needed for uploading chunks are not visible (though the most recent
// chunk fetcher may be accessed via the -activeFetcher or -chunkFetcher methods, and
// -responseHeaders and -statusCode reflect results from the most recent chunk
// fetcher.)
//
// Chunk fetchers are discarded as soon as they have completed.
//
// The protocol also allows for a cancellation notification request to be sent to the
// server to allow discarding of the currently uploaded data and this will be sent
// automatically upon calling stopFetching if the upload has already started.
//
// Note: Unlike the fetcher superclass, the methods of GTMSessionUploadFetcher should
// only be used from the main thread until further work is done to make this subclass
// thread-safe.
