# Builder Widgets

Adds widgets for Builder.io editing, such as carousels, tabs, accordions, etc.

## How to use it

First, install the package

```bash
npm install @builder.io/widgets
```

When using the React SDK, just 
```ts
import '@builder.io/widgets'
```

Anywhere that you render a `<BuilderComponent ... />`, and now the widgets will register and be available in the editor and when rendering (including server side)
