Breaking Change ðŸ§¨: `userAttributes` now is parsed as an object - `JSON.stringify(userAttributes)` which preserves strings. Users no longer need to manually stringify anything unless they have explicitly included it in custom targeting attributes.

For example,

```js
userAttributes: {
  stringWithStrs: ['a', 'c'];
}
```

used to work as well as this,

```js
userAttributes: {
  stringWithStrs: ["'a'", "'c'"];
}
```

but now its not needed to manually stringify strings. This change was needed to preserve data types and strings so previously when we passed,

```js
userAttributes: {
  stringWithNums: ['1', '2'];
}
```

they were actual string numbers but we failed to parse it because we were not preserving the strings and users had to perform manual stringification hacks like `"'1'"` to achieve correct result. With this change stringified numbers/bools etc will work out of the box as expected showing less room for randomness.
